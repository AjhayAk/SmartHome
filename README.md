An IOT based home automation
In today's modern world, the need for a smart home automation system that can
control and monitor various home appliances and devices is increasing. Traditional methods
of controlling and monitoring home appliances involve manual operations, which can be
time-consuming and inconvenient. Additionally, these methods do not provide real-time
information about the status of the devices, which can lead to inefficiencies and increased
energy usage. To address this need, we propose an IoT-based Smart Home Automation
System that can control and monitor various home appliances and devices, such as fans,
lights, and air conditioners, in real-time.
The system consists of NodeMCU and a 4-channel relay module, which are connected
to the internet and can be controlled remotely through a mobile application or a web
interface. The system also includes a temperature sensor that can adjust the fan and light
settings based on the room temperature, providing optimal energy usage and cost savings.
The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly and energy-efficient system that can
improve the comfort and convenience of homeowners while reducing their energy bills.
